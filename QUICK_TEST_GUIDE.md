# Quick Test Guide: Username Fix

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **"Unknown User" Issue** - Posts now show real names
2. **Profile Link Errors** - All users now have usernames, profile links work

## 🧪 Test It Now

### Step 1: Refresh Your App
```bash
# In your terminal
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and **hard refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Step 2: Check Home Page
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/`
2. Look at posts - should see real names (no "Unknown User")
3. Click on any user name
4. Should load their profile successfully (no 406 errors)

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
✅ Creating user from API data: { firstName: "...", lastName: "...", username: "..." }
❌ No "Failed to load user profile" errors
❌ No 406 HTTP errors
```

## 📊 Database Verification

In Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check all users have usernames
SELECT first_name, last_name, username FROM users;
```

Should show 13 users, all with usernames in format `firstname.lastname`

## 🎉 Expected Results

- ✅ All posts show user names (Andrew Hubright, John Smith, etc.)
- ✅ Clicking names navigates to `/profile/username`
- ✅ Profile pages load successfully
- ✅ No "Unknown User" displays
- ✅ No 406 errors in console

## 🐛 If Something's Wrong

1. **Still seeing "Unknown User"?**
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Clear cache
   - Check console for errors

2. **Profile still 404?**
   - Check username in database (see SQL above)
   - Verify user exists with: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'firstname.lastname';`

3. **Other issues?**
   - Check `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for troubleshooting
   - Check browser console for specific errors
